# Making Tufte-inspired web pages

Making [edwardtufte/tufte-css][1] easier by adding HTML components.

## Example

To see the example, download or clone this repo, start a dev HTTP server in the repo and look at `example.html`. For example if you have python3 on your computer (which you likely do) you can cd to this directory and run:

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```

And then visit http://localhost:8000/example.html

## Use
To use this in your own project, simply copy the contents of `tufte` into your web assets and modify your HTML as demonstrated in `example.html`.
